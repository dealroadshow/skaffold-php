## PHP classes for programmatic generation of Skaffold config

[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev) is a command line tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes-native applications.

This repository contains the PHP classes, generated by [kodegen](https://github.com/dealroadshow/kodegen) from Skaffold json schema.
This allows you to work with Skaffold config in object-oriented manner, and generate it programmatically,
without templating `skaffold.yaml` file.

### Installation

In order to install this library, use Composer:

```
composer install dealroadshow/skaffold-php
```

After that you may build your Skaffold config from PHP objects.
